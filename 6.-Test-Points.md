 Test points allow us to measure the voltage at that point of the circuit board. In case of 
the board not working like it is purposed to, we can use the test points to check for any 
irregularity of voltage in the circuit. From there, we can pinpoint the area and start our 
troubleshooting for the board

### Masterboard
|Test point| Voltage |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| TP1  | GND  |
| TP2  | VBATTERY  |
| TP3  | 5V  |
| TP4  | 3.3V  |
| Mounting holes  | GND  |

### Slaveboard
|Test point| Voltage |
| :------------- | :------------- |
| TP1  | VBATTERY  |
| TP2  | 3.3V  |
| TP3  | 12V  |
| TP4  | Solenoid 1 Voltage  |
| TP5  | Solenoid 2 Voltage  |
| Mounting holes  | GND  |
