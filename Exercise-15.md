## Items needed:
* An assembled Smorphi mini / Smorphi<sup> 2</sup> robot
* A computer
* Internet connection
## Objectives of exercise:
1. Learn how to code in Java
2. Learn to use Android Studios
3. Self-exploration skills
4. Make your own app to control the robot

<br />
We recommend this exercise for slightly more advanced learners and learners who wish to have a challenge. There will be a lot of self-exploration, but we will eventually develop a version that is more guided

<br />

1 | Now that you have been exposed to coding, we can try to make our own app for the Smorphi robot. Coding in Java would be the same logic as coding in Arduino. You can look through the Java portion code of our current app here: https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi-App-Android/tree/main/SimpleBluetoothTerminal-final/app/src/main/java/de/kai_morich/smorphi_app The Java code is for the functions of the app, while the xml files controls how your app looks: https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi-App-Android/tree/main/SimpleBluetoothTerminal-final/app/src/main/res/layout
2 | Look through the files and run them in Android studio emulator to see how they work and function. You can download Android studio via this link: https://developer.android.com/studio. <br></br>We can run the emulator to simulate how the app work. <br> ![](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi-Wiki/blob/main/Robot%20exercises%20images/15/android%20studio%20emulator.jpg)
3 | Make and customise your own app from our code, or from writing your own code from scratch.
