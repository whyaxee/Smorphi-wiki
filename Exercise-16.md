## Items needed:
* An assembled Smorphi/ Smorphi2 robot
* A computer
* A USB to USB-c cable
* Internet connection
## Objectives of exercise:
1. In depth going through of the Smorphi library
2. Self-study exploration
3. Build your own version of the Smorphi library

Steps | Description
-- | -- 
1 | This process is actually a rather long, multidisciplinary and multi-step process. We might break them down into easier digestable steps in the future. But for now, for advance learners and learners that wish to have a challenge, you can look through all the header files in our Smorphi library and then see how  you can optimise and write your own version of the library.
2 | For Smorphi <sup> 2</sup> users, you can refer to the Smorphi <sup> 2</sup> library using this link: https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/blob/main/Smorphi2/ <br>For Smorphi mini users, you can refer to the Smorphi mini library using this link: https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/blob/main/Smorphi_mini/
3 | In the library, you can see C Header Source File (.h) and C++ Source Files (.cpp). <b r></br> ![](insert image link)
4 | As you scroll throught the header file, you can see the various functions that can be called in your code for the Smorphi. ![](insert image link) <br> Header files are meant to show the functions available in the library. Therefore, these functions are not defined in the file.
5 | In order to know what is going on behind every function, we have to take a look at the .cpp files. ![](insert image link) <br> You can see each function being defined here. <br></br> To have a better understanding of what each function does, you have take a look at [Smorphi Code Documentation](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Smorphi-Code-Documentation)
6 | Based on what you want Smorphi to do, you can create and add in your own functions to the .cpp files and .h files respectively.
7 | For advanced learners, you can try to optimise with regards to size of library, speed of the library, etc.
