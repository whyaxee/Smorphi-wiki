## Items needed:
* An assembled Smorphi/ Smorphi2 robot
* A computer
* A USB to USB-c cable
* Internet connection
## Objectives of exercise:
1. In depth going through of the Smorphi library
2. Self-study exploration
3. Build your own version of the Smorphi library

<br />

This process is actually a rather long, multidisciplinary and multi-step process. We might break them down into easier digestable steps in the future. But for now, for advance learners and learners that wish to have a challenge, you can look through all the header files in our Smorphi library and then see how  you can optimise and write your own version of the library.

You can optimise with regards to size of library, speed of the library, etc.
