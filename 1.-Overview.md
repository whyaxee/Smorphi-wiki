### Microcontroller chip
The masterboard provided is based off the ESP32-Wroom-32 chip in its core with added 
extensions. 

### Power Supply Options

There are 3 mutually exclusive ways to provide power to the board:
1) USB-C port, default power supply
2) 5V / GND header pins
3) 3V3 / GND header pins

Note: The power supply must be provided using only one of the options above, otherwise the 
board and/or the power supply source can be damaged.

### Input and Output

Each of the 19 digital pins on the ESP32 can be used as an input or output, using the 
analogRead() function.

### Communication

The ESP32 has a number of facilities for communicating with a computer, another ESP32, or 
other microcontrollers. The ESP32 provides wireless capabilites, namely Wi-Fi and Bluetooth. 
Wired capabilities include 3 SPI channels, 2 I2C channels, 2 I2S channels, 3 UART channels, 
Ethernet MAC interface, CAN 2.0 and IR(TX/RX). The Arduino software includes a serial 
monitor which allows a simple textual data to be sent to and from the board. The RX and TX 
LEDs on the board will flash when data is being transmitted via the ESP32-Wroom-32 chip 
and USB connection to the computer.

### Programming

The ESP32 can be programmed in different programming environments. You can use

• Arduino IDE

• Espressif IDF (IoT Development Framework)

• Micropython

• JavaScript

• LUA
