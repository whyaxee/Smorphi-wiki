There are up to 15 exercises here that accompanies your Smorphi and Smorphi2 kits.
For owners of a Smorphi, you can safely and easily follow the exercises up til exercise 7. From exercise 8 onwards, there may be some tasks you will not be able to complete due to the required sensors or parts not being included in your kit. 

## List of Robot exercises:
### [Exercise 1 - Putting your robot together](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-1)
Assemble your robot and linking your robot to its control app for a quick start.

### [Exercise 2 - Setting up your Smorphi for coding](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-2)
Learn about the various coding software and how to set them up which you will need to customise your Smorphi to perform various tasks. 

### [Exercise 3 - Documentation](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-3)
Look through and understand how to read coding documentation, and explore the various functions provided.

### [Exercise 4 - Basic Arduino coding](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-4)
Learn basic Arduino coding structures, like variables, loops and conditionals.

### [Exercise 5 - Temperature sensor](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-5) 
Set up and use your Smorphi kit's temperature sensor for various activities and purposes

### [Exercise 6 - Sound sensor](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-6)
Set up and use your Smorphi kit's sound sensors for various activities and purposes

### [Exercise 7 - Infrared (IR) for obstacle detection](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-7)
Set up and use your Smorphi kit's IR sensors for various obstacle detection purposes

### [Exercise 8 - Simple line following using 2 IR sensors](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-8)
Install your Smorphi kit's IR sensors on to your Smorphi2 for your Smorphi2 to follow a line on the ground

### [Exercise 9 - Line following and obstacle detection combine](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-9)
Challenge yourself by implementing line following with obstacle detection at the same time using just IR sensors

### [Exercise 10 - Simple maze navigation](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-10)
Code your Smorphi to allow it to navigate through a simple maze

### [Exercise 11 - Maze with shape change](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-11)
A slightly more complicated maze with varying widths that require shape change to navigate through

### [Exercise 12 - Pixycam](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-12)
Introducing the Pixycam usage and set up

### [Exercise 13 - Integrate pixycam onto robot](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-13)
Connecting Pixycam to your Smorphi2 as a sensor

### Exercise 14 - Object tracking using pixycam 
Using your Pixycam to track and follow objects

### [Exercise 15 - Make your own library](https://github.com/WefaaRobotics/Smorphi/wiki/Exercise-15)
Code exploration exercise to understand the background functions in depth
